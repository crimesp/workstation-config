#bashrc and alias shortcuts

#edit your ~/.bash_aliases to have these lines in it, pointing to the equivalent directory for this project
#.bash_aliases is a good distro free way for user configs instead of profile

export BASH_INCLUDES=~/git/workstation-config/bash
source $BASH_INCLUDES/.profile

#for other projects, create a similar pattern in the relevant repository and include them in profile the same ala:
export ACCOM_GIT_HOME=~/git/accomplish/
export ACCOM_BASH_INCLUDES=$ACCOM_GIT_HOME/cloudservices/workstation-config/bash
source $ACCOM_BASH_INCLUDES/.profile
